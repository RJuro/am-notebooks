## **Introduction**


The ecosystem concept has been gaining increasing attention among management scholars (Moore 1993; Iansiti and Levien 2004; Parente et al. 2019; Rong et al. 2020). Only within the last years, many scholars have initiated discussions about the conceptual origins of the ecosystems (Rong et al. 2015; Scaringella and Radziwon 2018) and the similarities and differences between ecosystems and inter-organisational networks (Shipilov and Gawer 2020) in an attempt to conceptualise the ecosystem construct (Rong and Shi 2014; Adner 2017) and develop the theory of ecosystems (Jacobides, Cennamo, and Gawer 2018; Kapoor 2018). Simultaneously, issues of fragmentation and a certain level of ambiguity in regards to the use of the ecosystem concept have been raised (e.g. Oh et al. 2016; Adner 2017; Ritala and Almpanopoulou 2017).

While referring to ecosystems management studies typically focus on inter- organisational linkages and networks, interdependencies and coevolution (Ahuja, Soda, and Zaheer 2012; Dyer and Singh 1998; Owen-Smith and Powell 2004; Provan, Fish, and Sydow 2007; Radziwon and Bogers 2019). The most common ecosystem type is the business ecosystem, which was first introduced by Moore (1993), followed by the innovation ecosystem (Adner 2017; Dias Sant´Ana et al. 2020), the service ecosystem (Trischler, Johnson, and Kristensson 2020), the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Cavallo, Ghezzi, and Balocco 2019), the knowledge ecosystem (Aaldering, Leker, and Song 2019) and also recently discussed the platform ecosystem (Panico and Cennamo 2020). In order to shed some more light on the field, our research will focus on one of the most controversial concepts within the ecosystem domain, namely the innovation ecosystem (Oh et al. 2016; Adner 2017; Ritala and Almpanopoulou 2017). In particular, we will explore the concept of regional innovation ecosystem (RIE) (Ritala et al. 2013; Radziwon, Bogers, and Bilberg 2017) and its dynamic nature (Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007; Attour and Burger-Helmchen 2014; Rong, Patton, and Chen 2018b; Rong, Lin, Li, Burstrom, Butel, and Yu 2018).


Different from the concept of an innovation system, which is mainly focused on the static view (Cooke, Gomez Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997), the innovation ecosystem with a focus on dynamics and coevolution has been regarded as a key driver of regional innovation (Thomas 2016). Within the area of the innovation system, the concept of regional innovation system (RIS) is generated with considerations of regional factors contributing to innovation performance (Braczyk, Cooke, and Heidenreich 1998). A RIS can be defined as _a set of interacting private and public interests, formal institutions, and other organisations that function according to organisational and institutional arrangements and relationships conducive to the generation, use, and dissemination of knowledge _(Lund and Karlsen 2020; Ritala et al. 2013; Radziwon, Bogers, and Bilberg 2017). However, RISs were more separate and dedicated to their own business and skills within their own regions, and failed to make good value by connecting to the other RISs (Belussi, Sammarra, and Sedita 2010). Nowadays a company can have various linkages and cooperation with external actors, and the importance of these external ties has been increasingly recognised as a crucial factor in accelerating technological changes and innovation processes (Karna, Täube, and Sonderegger 2013). Hence, in this research we propose and further discuss the concept of regional innovation ecosystem (RIE).


Several challenges are faced during the emergence, development and coevolution of stakeholders in an RIE. These are related to establishing and building relationships between ecosystem stakeholders, coping with industry uncertainties and ensuring sustainable ecosystem development (Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007; Rong, Liu, and Shi 2011). In order to disentangle some of these challenges from the overall complexity of the ecosystem multilayer nature, this paper focuses on answering two research questions 1) how organisations coevolve within an ecosystem in a specific region and 2) how it affects their ecosystems. Following this logic, this paper reports findings from an in-depth case study of the three most representative RIEs in China. These are located in the Bohai Delta, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. Our finding led us to develop a framework that comprehensively outlines the static and dynamic nature of the RIEs. Exploring RIEs offers interesting managerial implications for practitioners and policymakers alike by (1) providing insights into a better redistribution of roles and coordination of ecosystem resources (Snehota and Hakansson 1995), (2) delivering a better understanding of the dynamic nature of ecosystem development (Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007) and (3) inspiring the practitioners to further explore their complementary partners (Lorenzoni and Lipparini 1999).


The paper begins with a literature review, proceeds to more in-depth insights into the research design and data collection in the methodology section, goes into a discussion of the identified configuration patterns and capabilities of the RIE, and concludes by suggesting avenues for further research.


## **2. Literature review**


Scaringella and Radziwon (2018) explored the ecosystem archetypes, through the territorial approach that takes into account not only economic but also social factors important for the exchange of knowledge. Even though, from the archetypes point of view, the regional innovation system (RIS) is seen as one of the (regional) innovation ecosystem predecessors, the connection between the two constitutes an interesting theoretical and practical gap that we intend to explore. In the following section, we propose the key highlights of an in-depth analysis of the territorial and ecosystem literature, which we conclude by identifying the key concepts that play a major role in the coevolution process among ecosystem members in China.


### 
**_2.1.	Regional innovation systems_**


Within the current literature, there are two construct elements, _social network _(Granovetter 1985) or _community network_, and _industrial system _(Saxenian 1996) or _value network _(Chesbrough 2003), which are imperative to a RIS (Gordon and McCann 2000). We further elaborate on the importance of these constructs for RIS and for simplicity we will use the community network and value network terminology throughout the manuscript.


First, the _social network or community network_, which includes financial capital, social capital and human capital, is a critical resource pool to support the development of a RIS. The financial capital, which particularly comprises seed capital, venture capital and government funds, is identified as the success factor that supports a system’s innovation (Chiaroni and Chiesa 2006). The skilled human capital, both cultivated by the local universities and attracted from outside, makes up the fundamental soft infrastructure for the growth of a knowledge-intensive RIS (Cooke 2001). Social capital is defined as the ability to secure resources by virtue of membership (Su and Hung 2009). It enables the linkage between different organisations. Especially in emerging countries like China, the term ‘Guanxi’ is used to describe very close social capital which could generate value (Knight and Yueh 2008).


Second, besides the community network of those who are loosely connected, there are some established _industrial systems _with a matured value network in each RIS. Factors like entrepreneurship and networking within the value network are essential to the success of an RIS (Lin, Li, and Chen 2006). Entrepreneurship is a critical element in the formation and viability of innovative industries and the RIS (Feldman, Francis, and Bercovitz 2005). Local entrepreneurs also facilitate the quality of mutual dependence and networking among organisations (Owen-Smith et al. 2006). In addition to the local network, there are also networks linking different parts of the region as well as linking the region to other regions and to other countries (Lundvall 2010). In this sense, RISs should not be percived as isolated entities, since they are encapsulated in national and supra-national innovation systems.


The current literature has mainly focused on examining the key construct elements, including the community network and value network (Gordon and McCann 2000), but it is still a relatively static way to look at the structure of a RIS (Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007; Attour and Burger-Helmchen 2014). Unfortunately, a more dynamic look at the interaction and coevolution of the different construct elements driving the evolution of a RIS has been less addressed in current literature (Ritala et al. 2013; Radziwon, Bogers, and Bilberg 2017).


Hence, in light of the static view of the research on RIS in current literature, this paper proposes the application of the concept of the RIE to extend current research with a more dynamic view.


### 
**_2.2.   RIE_**


The ecosystem approach is based on ecology. The term business ecosystem was described as an economic community composed of interacting industrial organisations, government, institutions, customers and other stakeholders, who coevolve and share their fate with each other (Gawer and Cusumano 2014; Iansiti and Levien 2004; Rong et al. 2013). It addresses the interaction and coevolution between value networks and their dynamic environment (Rong and Shi 2014; Rong et al. 2015, 2013). Meanwhile, companies can be seen as not only members of an industry, but also part of a business ecosystem that covers several industries (Moore 1993). This is common especially for emerging industries (Liu and Rong 2015; Ma et al. 2018; Rong, Patton, and Chen 2018b). Hence, interactions and coevolution play an essential role in sustaining the ecosystem in an evolutionary way (Moore 1993); companies in a business ecosystem are not only working cooperatively and competitively but are also coevolving around a new innovation to support new products and (or) services to satisfy customer needs (Scaringella and Radziwon 2018; Radziwon and Bogers 2019). That is why this paper proposes the application and further develops the concept of an RIE to reflect both the static and dynamic elements of the RIS and to address both internal and external linkages and coevolutions.


Rooted in the origin of the business ecosystem, we define the regional innovation ecosystem as _a regional innovation community consisted of stakeholders such as industrial organisations, governments, institutions, and customers who dynamically interact and co- evolve with each other and the uncertain environment, to achieve ongoing technological innovation and development_. This definition is in line with the idea that such an ecosystem requires a high level of collaborative arrangement (Adner 2006). Interdependencies, interactions and coevolution are essential to the success of an innovation ecosystem, as it has already been highlighted in the original proposal of the business ecosystem concept (Iansiti and Levien 2004; Rong, Patton, and Chen 2018; Radziwon and Bogers 2019). In this study, we follow Iansiti and Levien (2004: 76) for whom interdependencies mean that _”the company must share the fate of the other participants in the ecosystem”_, while at the same time having an independent value proposition (Adner 2012, 2017). Close inter-firm collaboration and open innovation is essential to enable technology advancements within the context of highly interconnected business ecosystems (Masucci, Brusoni, and Cennamo 2020). To effectively support a given technology policy makers should also consider the technological ecosystem (Pichler, Lafond, and Farmer 2020). The coevolutionary nature of an ecosystem is expressed by the ecosystem members’ experience in changes to the equilibrium caused by external constraints (emerging from an ecosystem’s business environment) and its return to a temporary stabilisation, allowing new structures and order to be created. In more practical terms, this self-driven mechanism, which tends to be externally moderated, covers simultaneous coevolution of firm capabilities and leads to mutual adaptation (Radziwon and Bogers 2019). Interactions encompass collaborative activities and behaviours with or without monetary transactions, which contribute to the development of both strong and weak ties between ecosystem members.


Hence innovation ecosystems should by definition place emphasis on collaboration (Granstrand and Holgersson 2020). It has also been highlighted that companies need to create an appropriate strategy to mitigate risks in such a complex and uncertain innovation ecosystem (Adner 2006). In this way, the concept of an innovation ecosystem will be very valuable and appropriate to model the economic dynamics of complex relationships. Unlike previous research on RIS that focus on the interactions of its two static construct elements (community network and value network), this research emphasises the co- evolutionary nature of the proposed concept of RIE. As a consequence, this paper develops a 4C framework in the following section to guide the research on RIE.


### 
**_2.3.   4 C framework_**


Following case study logic proposed by Gioia, Corley, and Hamilton (2013), we first identify and explore the key concepts that play a major role in the coevolution process among ecosystem members. In order to explore both the static and the dynamic nature and to uncover how organisations coevolve within an ecosystem and how it affects their ecosystems, we have developed a 4C research framework (see Figure 1). This conceptual research framework is based on a broad literature review and follows the logic of the 3C framework (Lin et al. 2009; Shi and Gregory 1998; Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007), which was originally proposed to analyse a complex network system with the argument that a certain system structure and relationship form a certain configuration pattern which

**Figure 1. **Research framework for exploring the RIE.


then generates a certain capability. The 4C framework is used to better understand an RIE. In particular, it guides the data collection analysis that ensures the internal validity of the research (Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki 2008).


As shown in Figure 1, the first C – ‘construct’ – indicates the building blocks of an RIE. The second C – ‘cooperation’ – reflects the interaction mechanisms among those building blocks. The third C – ‘configuration’ – categorises the RIE into different patterns based on the construct and cooperation. The last C – ‘capabilities’ – describes the ecosystem’s ability to coevolve and sustain innovation activities.


#### 
**_2.3.1.  Construct_**


As discussed above, the _community network _and the _value network _are identified as the two main construct elements when analysing an RIS. However, innovation activities within the value network are being examined in a relatively independent way (Feldman, Francis, and Bercovitz 2005; Su and Hung 2009). The ecosystem literature considers those community network elements and innovation activities to be interrelated and as coevolved to create value within an economic community (Iansiti and Levien 2004). Meanwhile, they will interact with the value network through their synergy effect (Battistella et al. 2013). Accordingly, the ecosystem approach will extend the analysis focus from entrepreneurship and networking to a systematic perspective of the value network covering R&D, production and sales in the value network (Rong and Shi 2014).


#### 
**_2.3.2.  Cooperation_**


In terms of the relationship among the different construct elements and how they work with each other, the system approach to analysing the RIS mainly concerns the support of the internal and external resource pool to the entrepreneurship and networking within the value network (Belussi, Sammarra, and Sedita 2010). Meanwhile, the innovation and the competitiveness of entrepreneurs enhance the financial capacity of the RIE by enabling a financial mechanism and rewarding the financial capital (Cooke, Gomez Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). However, from an ecosystem view, the value network needs to coevolve with the resource pool of the community network. The coevolution, an adaptation of the community network and the value network are considered a reinforcing cycle, where the resource pool of the community network supports the innovation activity (Geels 2005). And the value network rewards the community network by further enabling the resource pool of human, financial and social capital (Cooke 2001; Iansiti and Levien 2004).


#### 
**_2.3.3.  Configuration_**


With a system approach, RIS research classifies its configuration into spontaneous and policy-driven patterns statically (Sofouli and Vonortas 2007). The spontaneous configuration pattern is the result of the spontaneous co-presence of key factors (Chiaroni and Chiesa 2006). The presence of excellent scientific bases and technology transferring mechanisms are key factors for the emergence of the spontaneous configuration pattern (Su and Hung 2009). The policy-driven configuration pattern is triggered by the strong commitment of governmental actors whose willingness sets the conditions for the cluster creation (Huang, Yu, and Seetoo 2012; Yang 2010). It is widely held that the policy-driven pattern is more sponsored in emerging economies and less supported in developed economies (Huang, Yu, and Seetoo 2012). The policy-driven configuration pattern, for example the industry parks (that are organised by the local government at the county level) and science parks (that are organised by the central government at the national level), become a popular innovation system for industrial development in emerging economies (Sofouli and Vonortas 2007). In some cases, there are hybrid patterns triggered by mixed processes from the two above patterns (Chiaroni and Chiesa 2006), which means that the government coordinates and enables elements like human capital and financial capital that already existed (Huang, Yu, and Seetoo 2012).


However, the evolutionary processes and mechanisms of these two patterns are still unclear, but this is what needs to be explored by the use of the ecosystem lens. From an ecosystem perspective, the evolution and coevolution of different configuration patterns along its lifecycle could be driven by mixed stakeholders (Moore 1996). All the stakeholders are encouraged to contribute to the development of the RISs and share their fate. The spontaneous configuration pattern of RIE could emerge from the complex interrelations among key factors (Nachira, Dini, and Nicolai 2007). The policy-driven configuration pattern may be triggered by the government’s endeavour of nurturing related stakeholders to enable the growth of the innovation system (Rothschild 1990), and the hybrid configuration pattern could be triggered by the coevolution of key factors in hybrid configuration patterns (Richardson, Yamin, and Sinkovics 2012).


#### 
**_2.3.4.  Capability_**


It is believed that a certain system configuration will create certain system capabilities or that certain capabilities are generated from a certain system configuration (Lin et al. 2009). In this research, this logic was applied to the analysis of regional innovation. Only a few types of research on the RIS have examined the role of system capability. Firm capability shows how well the firm explores and exploits internal and external resources, while in an RIE, capabilities could demonstrate how a value network evolves by coordinating other stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem. Through an ecosystem lens, complementors play an essential role in the success of the innovation strategy (Adner 2006), and coordinating with those ecosystem stakeholders is extremely important (Lorenzoni and Lipparini 1999). That is why the capability of ‘complementor readiness’ is usually regarded as one of the most important indicators showing the health of a business ecosystem in the process of acquiring internal and external resources. As a result, connection capability, which is the ability to build connections with both internal and external actors and other innovation ecosystems, becomes very important to ensure the success of an innovation ecosystem (Gawer and Cusumano 2014; Rong et al. 2015). However, the RIS puts emphasis on the capability of internal interactions but ignores the capability of external connections (Zhang and Liang 2011). In an ecosystem context, such external connections are usually built on a certain platform within a global context (Gawer and Cusumano 2014).


    These four dimensions are summarised in Table 1.

As presented in Table 1, the dimensions of the construct, cooperation, configuration and capability provide a comprehensive, systematic and dynamic perspective in exploring the evolution of an RIE. The construct identifies the value network and community network, but has extended the traditional scope of the RIS and addressed the coevolution of key constructs systematically. The characteristics of industrial transformation and feedback are also reviewed to help identify the connotation of cooperation. As for the configuration pattern of the innovation ecosystem, the hybrid of spontaneous and policy- driven patterns extends the existing single configuration pattern of either the spontaneous or policy-driven one. This system configuration could generate certain ecosystem capabilities which support the performance of a series of effective innovation activities. Within an ecosystem, complementary and connection capabilities could enable the resource accessibility and cooperation of the RIE.


## **3. Research methods**


### 
**_3.1.   Case studies_**


Due to the contemporary nature of the RIE, this research has adopted a case study methodology (Yin 2009). Furthermore, in order to enhance the robustness of the research results, it uses multiple case studies, and each case, because of the longitudinal case study approach, provides even more compelling evidence and produces more robust conclusions than a single case study of a point-in-time snapshot. In order to improve the reliability (Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki 2008) and quality of our theory building (Weick 1995, 1989), we have designed the following case study selection protocol (Table 2). First, this research focuses on three RIEs located at Shandong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which represent the key economic regions in China: _the Bohai Delta, the Yangtze River Delta _and _the Pearl River Delta_. The Bohai Delta is a high-efficient eco- economic zone consisting of both traditional manufacturing industries, including machine equipment industries, and green manufacturing industries like the e-vehicle manufacturing industry. The Yangtze River Delta is more specialised in the semiconductor and biotech industries, while the Pearl River Delta has most advantages within consumer electronics. What is more, these RIEs have simultaneously engaged in several sectors, including the mobile computing, electric vehicle and semiconductor industries. Using the Shenzhen RIE as an example, it developed its sectors from VCD, mobile 2G and smartphones towards tablets by synthesising specialists from the Shanghai and Taiwan RIEs (Rong, Liu, and Shi 2011).


Second, this study explores those RIEs by investigating key projects and sector transformations as shown in Figure 2. For each individual project, several senior project managers are interviewed to build longitudinal knowledge base of the projects and industry developments. Most of the interviewees had at least 15 years of working experience in thir company (at the time of the interview), which made them sufficiently informed about the development in their regions.


Third, we have selected the most representative companies in each region that have the most comprehensive experience of the development of the whole region. In addition, these companies were fully or partly involved in the region’s innovation development.

Fourth, the selected case companies played an important role at the centre of each of their respective RIEs. In particular they owned the product platforms that other stakeholders, such as suppliers, training centres, financial capital providers, policymakers and industrial associations, could add value to. The interviewees also confirmed this.


These selection criteria ensured that the theory development process included an explicit framework and an accurate and detailed representation (Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki 2008). The interview questions and interviewee list are included in order to present the case data and data sources. The data coding and analysis with the 4C framework are proposed to link the raw data, research framework and research findings. This also ensures both the internal and construct validity of the research (Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki 2008).


Table 2 shows the differences between these cases in terms of the five criteria that aim to cover a wide range of different sectors and stages of development of each RIE. The first two criteria are used to select a specific region and companies for the main case studies, while the last three criteria are used to identify the relevant interviewees within the selected cases.

**_3.2.   Data collection_**


Data were collected mainly through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with managers and took place between April 2010 and August 2016. To ensure data reliability and construct validity, the interviews were conducted using pre-designed guidelines focusing on the 4C dimensions in the proposed conceptual framework of RIE (Yin 2009). The interview details are present in Table 3. In total, we visited 31 interviewees, and the total interview duration was over 63 hours. The secondary data include documents, news, company information and industrial associations’ reports.

**_3.3.   Data analysis_**


RIE as the unit of analysis is fairly non-conventional (Lorenzoni and Ferriani 2008) as the research typically focuses on the network of firms and organisations. This research adopted several strategies for data analysis.


_Roadmap and process mapping_: Following the nature of roadmap methods (Phaal, Farrukh, and Probert 2004) and a process research approach, we have summarised the longitudinal data on the evolutionary process to help understand the industrial transformation.


_Ecosystem perspective_: This research aims at better understanding regional innovation through this approach to explore both the static and dynamic nature of the RIE.


_Comparative analysis_: This research conducts a c_ross-project analysis _for each RIE to compare companies’ engagement in different industrial sectors; _cross-case analysis _is conducted for each RIE in order to generalise the results, and _cross-region analysis _is conducted to understand the differences and links among those three regions. Such a cross- comparative analysis ensures the external validity of the research (Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki 2008).


### 
**_3.4.	Summary of case studies_**


Following the case studies, we have summarised the key features of each case in terms of the 4 C dimensions of an RIE in Table 4.


Within the last 30 years, from being dominated by central government initiatives to being motivated by the government and supported significantly by entrepreneurs’ collaboration, the Shenzhen RIE experienced four stages of industrial development, moving


from VCD, mobile 2G, smartphones to the tablet era. Through this transformation journey, the three case companies realised the importance of the cooperation between the Shenzhen RIE and other RIEs like the Shanghai Design Centre and Dongguan’s Manufacturing Centre, which have capabilities that are complementary to theirs. Their development and interaction with other stakeholders could be regarded as the typical coevolutionary development of the Shenzhen RIE.


Founded on the long-established vehicle manufacturing capability in the Shandong province, the Shandong RIE developed strong learning and manufacturing capabilities (over 100 suppliers, manufacturers, universities and research centres devoted their business to the low-speed EV area). Unlike the Shenzhen RIE, the production of low- speed EV is only supported by the local government, that is why sales is limited to rural areas. Nevertheless, close cooperation among those stakeholders and good knowledge of the local and nearby market play a critical role in facilitating the rapid development of the Shangdong RIE for the EV industry.


Founded in July 1992, ZJHP is located in the central part of the Pudong New Area with a planned area of 25 km<sup>2</sup>. Since 2000, ZJHP has been in a high-speed development period and become a national microelectronics base, in particular for the IC industry. The increasingly wide and deep global linkage, strong cooperation with universities, heavy investments and the strong policy support have all strengthened the local innovation capability and cooperation to form the ZJHP RIE.


## **4. Research findings**


### 
**_4.1.	The static view of an RIE: construct_**


The research results have shown that the constructs of the RIE can be identified as a community network and a value network. For each RIE, these two construct elements should exist simultaneously as a stable structure, but the structural details of these two elements vary from RIE to RIE.


For the community network, elements like social capital, financial capital and human capital play essential roles in supporting the growth of the value network (Kudic 2013). For example, in the case of the RIE in Shenzhen, the resource pool of the community network includes tax discount and infrastructure packages offered by the local government, which have attracted a large number of investors and thus enabled the emergence of the RIS. This introduces the financial capital to the region that further promotes the growth of the RIE. In the RIE of Shandong, the focal firm Shifeng gets the support of a financial capital company to extend its EV business. Besides this, Shifeng also acquired the support of human capital by inviting the key scholars and policymakers from famous universities. This enables the accumulation of social capital through the creation of communities that can influence the policy-making process of the central government. In the RIE case of Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, the beneficial policies at national and local levels provide resource pools, including financial investment and talent cultivation. The increasing overseas returnees are a critical enabler of the RIE’s emergence and growth. They bring in the resources of overseas funding and connection with local and global partners, as in the case of Spreadtrum.


As for the value network, activities like entrepreneurship and networking between stakeholders promote the evolution of the RIE. As for the RIE in Shenzhen, there are intensive activities such as local entrepreneurs and intra- and inter-RIE networks in the value network. For example, the focal firm MTK established networks with the RIEs in Taiwan, Shenzhen and Shanghai to get access to foundry, manufacturing and design resources, respectively. Whilst in the RIE of Shandong, the focal firm built a network to outsource the production of a few components and enabled the marketing of its EV products.


### 
**_4.2.	Dynamic view of an RIE: cooperation_**


Following these exploratory case studies, this paper argues that it is necessary for researchers within this field to contemplate an alternative conceptual research framework to explore the dynamic and evolutionary nature of an RIE. The system constructs analysed above provide basic elements for the further analysis of an RIE’s dynamic nature – cooperation, defined as the interdependencies, interaction and coevolution of those elements. The interactions and coevolutions among those construct elements are the key difference between the traditional system approach and the ecosystem approach to the development of RIEs. For instance, in the ZJHP case, the dedicated government’s support and overseas returnees promote the forming of wide and deep global linkages within the value network. In addition, the cooperation with IMEC from Belgium and Jazz from the USA provides sources for HHNEC to assimilate related knowledge and build the indigenous capability.


The research results have demonstrated that the constructive elements interact with each other in nurturing and developing an emerging industries. Besides the construct elements like the value network and community network, we also identified two cooperation elements, namely industrial transformation and industrial feedback (as shown in Figure 3), as the interaction mechanisms between constructive elements.


The building block of the community network is actually a resource pool, which shows that RIE players could make value of their social ties. This is very important, especially at

**Figure 3. **The dynamic nature of an RIE.


the emerging stage of the new industrial development. Within an RIE, the key for companies is to make an innovative idea become a product/service in the industry network to provide value to customers. Hence, the cooperation elements play essential mechanism roles of interaction and coevolution between the value network and the community network. Such a mechanism has two parts; first, it is the processes transforming the community network into a value network; second, it is the feedback loop allowing the value network to enrich the resource pool/community network. For example, the MTK case shows how the original innovative idea became an innovative product that provided value to the market. Lastly, it enhances the community network to further develop innovative ideas. We can see that the ecosystem approach highlights the dynamics of an RIE and provides a disclosure of the evolutionary process of an RIE. This is also the reason that an RIE can transfer from one sector to another.


### 
**_4.3.	Configuration pattern of an RIE_**


Based on the analysis of construct and cooperation, the research results have indicated that there are three typical configuration patterns of an RIE, namely purely policy-driven, spontaneously driven and mixed-driven. Different RIEs can show different features of the configuration pattern. Furthermore, different companies in the same RIE may possibly even experience different features of the above three patterns. For example, as China only opened its doors in the late 1970s and the central government heavily drove the economy until then, all of these RIEs started with government policies driving them. However, Shandong and Shenzhen mainly sustained their development by local grass-roots power, and the ZJHP was still relying on policy support. Policy plays an essential role in the development of RIEs in China.


The success of the Shenzhen RIE relied on its platform that integrated the innovative ideas from worldwide contacts and nations as well as the capabilities of other RIEs, such as the design capabilities in Shanghai and the foundry capabilities in Taiwan. This RIE would get the most out of its innovative ideas very quickly, since it was close to Hong Kong and could get access to the world markets. In the meantime, due to the accumulation of resources, it could quickly turns such ideas into real products. This RIE has specialised in providing the total solution for any innovative ideas, especially in the consumer electronics industry.


The Shandong RIE was previously the key vehicle manufacturing cluster in China. The main sectors, transforming from vehicles for agricultural use to electric vehicles in the Shandong RIE, relied on their embeddedness in the local demand and their understanding of the big trends of the green economy. It acted similarly to the Shenzhen RIS by connecting the stakeholders with specialised capabilities in different nationwide RISs. However, it also faced challenges in terms of following the central government’s policies. In this case, policy became an obstacle instead of a driving force.


The ZJHP RIE was mainly developed through being policy-driven. However, due to the global trend, overseas talents and returnees also brought in international resources to stimulate the ZJHP’s development. Due to the complex nature of the semiconductor industry, ZJHP still relied more on the governmental support. That is the reason why this RIE seemed to be more stable instead of dynamic.


In summary, the configuration of the RIE becomes more complicated rather than policy-driven, spontaneous or mixed. It becomes more dynamically changing when various stakeholders such as policymakers, institutions, firms or even overseas returnees can drive the evolution of the configuration as well.


### 
**_4.4.	Capabilities for an RIE_**


For each RIE, a certain configuration will create a certain capability to support the development and evolution of the RIE, in particular in an emerging industry like the electric vehicle industry (Shang and Shi 2013). We have discovered two key capabilities that the previous research might have neglected, but which are important to the process of nurturing and development of an RIE. The first one is complementarity and the other is the connection. Each RIE has usually specialised in the same products or industries. However, when the products became more complicated, an inter-RIE collaboration became necessary. The ecosystem perspective required the firm to identify the complementary products that could facilitate its own products’ commercialisation in an inter- RIE collaborative context. The Shenzhen and Shandong RIEs are very good at finding complementary products to enrich their own products. For example, they found the batteries supplier, mobile and vehicle designer for the products in other RIEs.


The second capability is a _connection_. The connection dimensions address the intra- company, inter-company and inter-country RIE collaboration. Complementarity is mainly defined as the local connection within a single country. However, the connection means that, as an innovative RIE, you should have a global connection and a local connection as well. For example, the ZJHP RIE specialised in the semiconductor industry that has various global connections. Thus, this RIE benefits from global talents and resources, and the overseas returnees bridged that gap.


The complementarity and connection both indicate the key idea of an ecosystem approach: the interaction and coevolution between stakeholders in worldwide RIEs. The stakeholders need to acquire these two capabilities in order to make the value needed by coordinating those RIEs and coping with the industrial dynamics.


## **5. Concluding discussion**


The traditional thinking of the RIS mainly focused on a static view, only exploring what the system has and how to operate it (Cooke, Gomez Uranga, and Etxebarria 1997). RISs were more separate and dedicated to their own business and skills within their own regions and failed to make good value by connecting to the other RISs, but while they failed to understand why such an RIS should sustain its development and evolve into the different sectors, the boundaries of the RIS seemed to vanish in step with the intensified globalisation (Belussi, Sammarra, and Sedita 2010). Nowadays a company can have various linkages and cooperation with external actors, and the importance of these external ties has been increasingly recognised as a crucial factor in accelerating technological changes and innovation processes (Karna, Täube, and Sonderegger 2013). That is why this research proposed to explore regional innovation with an ecosystem approach to comprehensively understand the static and dynamic nature of an RIE as well as the synergy effects between RIEs. The ecosystem approach contains four dimensions: construct, cooperation, configuration and capability. The traditional view on the RIS failed to understand the dynamics and evolution of the RIS development and cannot properly explain the industrial transformation within the RISs. In addition, the traditional studies have also been unsuccessful in exploring the linkages and synergy among those RISs and how to make value of those synergies (Scaringella and Radziwon 2018). The ecosystem approach addressed these two issues by offering a better picture of the interdependencies, interactions and coevolution of constructive elements and the way to play the role of a specialised capability with the concept of RIE.


Most of the cases are neither driven solely by the government nor solely by entrepreneurs, but by a mixture of stakeholders. The configuration patterns of an RIE have become more complicated than ever before. An ecosystem approach encourages all the stakeholders to contribute and add value to the evolution of an RIE. That is why the ecosystem perspective offers a better opportunity for the sustainable development of an RIE. This paper encourages the policymakers to understand the roles of different RIEs and then provide the supporting policies to facilitate the collaboration between those RIEs.


The main output of this study is an empirically validated conceptual framework that helps to develop a comprehensive understanding of the RIE concept. We have explored each dimension by an in-depth analysis of the interdependencies, interaction and coevolution.


### 
**_5.1.	Theoretical contribution_**


#### 
**_5.1.1.   From system to ecosystem approach_**


The research results indicate that there are four aspects that the traditional RIS (Belussi, Sammarra, and Sedita 2010) could learn from. We summarise this as an ecosystem approach: The traditional view on RIS is relatively static by summarising the construct elements, but it has failed to explore the dynamic nature of the interaction between them and the nature of their coevolution. The ecosystem approach indicates the interaction between those elements and the transformation and feedback enriching the RIE resource pool. It is very important to understand the cycle between the existing value network and the community network (e.g. resource pool, social network); how they can continuously interact and consolidate both sides. Subsequently, the RIE could produce more sustainable cross-sector innovation.


#### 
**_5.1.2.  4C framework_**


In order to fully understand an RIE, this paper develops a 4C framework to explore both its static and dynamic nature. This is based on the original 3C framework for analysing a complex network system (Lin et al. 2009; Shi and Gregory 1998; Zhang, Gregory, and Shi 2007). The construct indicates the RIE building blocks, while the cooperation explains the interaction between those building blocks and how to consolidate them for future innovation. The configuration demonstrates the typical patterns of RIEs with different drivers, while the capabilities introduce the ability that the RIE needs to evolve for future innovation.


#### 
**_5.1.3.   Linkage among sector and national innovation systems_**


Furthermore, by fully exploring the RIE with the proposed 4 Cframework, we also discovered how an RIE could link with a sectoral innovation system (SIS) (Malerba 2002) and a national innovation system (NIS) (Lundvall 2010) so as to secure an integrated effect as shown in Figure 4. This is because each specialised RIE is based on different sectors (for example, chip, design or software industries) who could work together to produce a mobile phone. Meanwhile, those sectors are based in RIEs with various geographic locations. All of those systems (RIS, SIS and RIE) together finally generate the NIS as a whole. Then, the ecosystem view could link the RIE, the NIS and the SIS, which could then explain the relationship of those concepts.


#### **_5.1.4.	Extending the ecosystem approach by connecting geographic and sector dimensions_**


Studies on the business ecosystem usually neglect the dimension of geographic location; instead, they use the product or industrial platform to connect those stakeholders worldwide in different regions (Gawer and Cusumano 2014). However, in most of the cases in this RIE research, each component supplier or complementor is mainly clustered in specific regions. In other words, the task for the keystone firm of an RIE is to not only know the right roles but also know the place to connect the roles.


Thus, the geographic dimension could enrich the research on RIE by both understanding the role of local complementors and their connection with global complementors and other stakeholders. The business ecosystem study is mainly on the complementary view, while the RIE study includes the geographic dimensions, which could inspire the RIE study to seek an understanding of the complementors and other stakeholders in a global context.

**Figure 4. **RIE: Integrating RIS and SIS.


### 
**_5.2.   Practical implications_**


#### 
**_5.2.1.  Management implications_**


This paper provides several managerial implications for different roles like focal firm and complementors. Firstly, companies in an RIE should build a coevolutionary view to cooperate and interact with other stakeholders to achieve a better innovative performance. In particular, to the focal firms of each RIE, they should clearly identify the complementors in the region or other regions and try to establish connections with them as well as link its RIE with other RIEs in a local, national or global context. For example, the focal firm could provide a platform for connecting those complementors in the different RIEs.


Secondly, the key to success is to categorise the RIE into different roles with specialised functions and capabilities. The research results indicate the importance of interaction and coevolution, which is one of the key features of an RIE with the ecosystem approach – connecting with each other could mean a better innovative performance than when working individually. As a result, building connection capabilities is highly recommended to companies who are involved in the development of an RIE.


#### 
**_5.2.2.  Policy implications_**


The research result highlighted the importance of policy in an RIE. Accordingly, this paper provides some feasible practical implications for the government: The central government should understand the different RIEs within the country and understand their roles and capabilities. Furthermore, the government should also understand how these RIEs could be connected with each other to produce an all-win synergy effect. This study can guide the government to issue the relevant policies to support such RIE developments. In summary, if those RIEs worked well with each other, the development of a national innovation system is expected.


### 
**_5.3. 	Research limitations and further research outlook_**


While this study contributes to both theory and managerial practices, it has a number of limitations. Our study concentrated on exploring and validating a 4C framework, which includes construct, cooperation, configuration and capability. Despite of the contributions offered by bridging the territorial and the ecosystem approach and linkages between sector and national innovation systems, there are number of questions that have emerged along the way.


First, community network and value network are very important constructs to consider when studying how organisations coevolve in ecosystems. Our study offers exploratory insights based on the three most representative Chinese regional innovation ecosystems. More research in other contexts and industries and applying different methodologies could increase the validity of this study. The latter point is very much in line with Shipilov and Gawer (2020) who suggest a further integration of maturing research on organisational and inter-organisational networks and, in particular, mapping these interdependencies (moving beyond technological components) by using graph-theoretic methods. Another interesting method, which could offer more insights into the actual innovation or the performance level of ecosystems that are characterised by causal complexity, is qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) (see Meuer, Rupietta, and Backes-Gellner (2015) and Meuer (2014) for examples of QCA application in innovation systems and inter-firm relations, respectively). In order to capture different configurations of the causes and the asymmetry of their effects on the innovation outcomes of innovation ecosystems, we would certainly need to be able to collect data from a larger number of ecosystems.


Second, our findings indicate the presence of three typical configuration patterns of an RIE, namely purely policy-driven, spontaneously driven and mixed-driven. As much as the purely policy-driven pattern may be related to the political system (central government influence on configuration dynamics), to further explore regulation driven innovation ecosystems to see to what extend a regional innovation ecosystem findings of a study embedded in central government influenced political system could inform studies of regulation driven and public support dependent ecosystems. Some examples of what innovation ecosystems could cover on the product side are renewable energy-centred ecosystems – e.g. within nanotechnology, the windmill industry (Knudsen, Frederiksen, and Goduscheit 2019) or the emerging transportation drone industry (Yaghmaie, Vanhaverbeke, and Roijakkers 2020). On the service side, further conceptual and empirical research conducted in the context of fintech or other data-driven and data protection innovation ecosystems could offer additional insights related to more industry-related configuration patterns.


Third, one of the aspects of high relevance and interest to innovation ecosystems and the ecosystem literature in general that was not specifically explored in our study, but has the potential to offer complementary insights in the context of cooperation and configuration, is related to the governance mechanisms of the innovation ecosystems. In particular, it would be interesting to further explore which are the best governance structures and ecosystem architectures for capturing the dynamic nature of the external environment by handling unforeseen contingencies and forming the foundation for systemic innovations while effectively managing multilateral interdependencies (Foss, Schmidt, and Teece 2020; Adner 2012, 2017). Moreover, in line with these thoughts, future research could also explore the relationship dynamics among organisations and industries and how these contribute to the generation, use and dissemination of knowledge within and across innovation ecosystems, which are in line with the recent open innovation ‘results triangle’ proposed by Chesbrough (2020).


Fourth, in our study, we extend a static RIS approach by looking beyond the capability of internal interactions by including the capability of external connections (Zhang and Liang 2011; Gawer and Cusumano 2014). In particular, our findings indicate the importance of complementarity and connections for nurturing and further developing an RIE. Further studies will benefit from an integration of the network effects literature (Katz and Shapiro 1994) as well as the service-dominant logic literature (Vargo and Lusch 2004, 2017) in ecosystem research. More specifically, both of these literature streams could be very useful in exploring the relationships between the number of RIE users/stakeholders and complementarity along with compatibility of the resources available or needed in an ecosystem. Following the efforts of Shipilov and Gawer (2020) within the area of bridging the network and ecosystem literature, a similar approach to integrate ecosystem literature with other concepts like service-dominant logic could offer new energy and broaden the theoretical and empirical toolkit for further investigation of innovation ecosystems.
